        Technique 101
    </h2>
    <p>
        As with every sport, you cannot escape injuries without proper technique. That is especially true in Muay Thai. In the past, I have gone through it the hard way by suffering countless injuries from going to gyms who did not provide the personal attention needed by their members. Anyone who goes to martial arts gyms will know what I am talking about when I say that there is always favouritism, partialism for their fighters instead of passionately spreading the art itself to the public. To me, this is fundamentally wrong. There seems to be an invisible rule that new members somehow have to prove themselves worthy of the attention and care factor by the gym. That should NOT be the case, as nobody should be discriminated by the sport. Not everyone wants to enter the ring and compete.
    </p>
    <p>
        All that is required of you is the willingness to learn and improve. The fact that you turn up wanting to improve your skillset is enough proof of that. It is commendable and I truly appreciate that.

        Redefining your Fitness with Muay Thai...
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is without a doubt one of the most effective, practical and beautiful combat sport today and thanks to the boom in the mixed martial arts(MMA) industry, the masses are starting to see this and we have seen a surge in demand as more MMA gyms incorporate muay thai classes as part of their schedule. However, while the demand has increased, it has also been unfortunately been closely associated with egotism, violence, injuries, knockouts, cuts, and a whole lot of blood. It is a combat sport after all. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The term 'martial arts' means that it is a form of ART and is open to interpretation by anyone who practices this art. As a practitioner, I want to spread my own perception of Muay Thai to others. Some might look at Muay Thai as a 'keep-fit' regimen, 'self-confidence' booster, 'self-defence' technique and many others. But I see it very differently...
    </p>
    <p>
        Muay Thai empowers you with a variety of things! The obvious things would be elevating your fitness levels, giving you self-defense skils or if you wish, competing with others for a sense of achievement. But it is so much more... It will pass onto you intangible yet valuable gains such as humility, self-confidence, self-esteem, mental toughness, situation awareness, self-respect, respect for others, fun-loving social interactions, and more! I am an embodiment whose life has been shaped by this. Let me share with you why everyone in the world will benefit from this.

        This is my story...
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unfit and I were a couple 10 years ago. Being a teenager and overly aware of my own physical limitations, I often complained about knee joint pains, calf tensions, and poor peformances in cardio-exercisies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I had exceedingly low self-esteem and self-confidence in the past and unfortunately became the target of some bullying probes. Maybe I should consider myself quite fortunate as they were mainly passive-aggressive and I have heard of some extreme bullying cases which I don't even want to delve into.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2006, Muay Thai had no presence in Singapore, a that time I was a teenager with had so much energy, both positive and negative, pent up inside of me with no method of channelling it. Simplying lifting weights, doing push-ups and running was no where close to expelling it. The simplicity of static and one-dimensional dynamic exercises was not exciting at all for me. But there was one thing I knew, and it was that I loved hitting this boxing bag at my neighbour's house. Something tells me that I am not alone on this... If you believe yourself or even your kids have a lot of energy pent up, I believe I will be able to solve that problem, just like I have for myself.
