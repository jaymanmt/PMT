        Technique 101
        </h2>
        <p>
        If you are worried about the 'brutality' of picking up a combat sport, your worries are unfortunately justified. In every sport, it is key to have correct technique or you will get injured at some point. I have gone through it the tough way by going to martial arts gyms which did not provide the personal attention needed by their members. Anyone who goes to these gyms will know what I am talking about when I say that there is immense favouritism and partialism for their fighters instead of passionately spreading the art itself to the public. To me, this is wrong. There seems to be an invisible rule that new members somehow have to prove themselves worthy of attention and care by the gym. That should NOT be the case, because nobody should be discriminated by the sport. Not everyone wants to enter the ring and compete.
        </p>
        <p>
        All that is required of you is the willingness to learn and improve. In my eyes, the fact that you turn up wanting to improve your skillset is proof of that and I think that in itself, is very commendable.
        </p>
        <p>
        In my personal one-to-one sessions, you will have my full attention and I will work closely with you to make sure you achieve your personal goals whether is it to lose weight, be a Muay Thai professional, or learning it for self-defense. You will attain all that while staying injury-free.

    <h2>
        Redefining your Fitness with Muay Thai...
    </h2>
    <p>
        Muay Thai is without a doubt one of the most effective, practical and beautiful combat sport today and thanks to the boom in the mixed martial arts(MMA) industry, the masses are starting to see this and we have seen a surge in demand as more MMA gyms incorporate muay thai classes as part of their schedule. However, while the demand has increased, it unfortunately has also been closely associated with egotism, violence, injuries, knockouts, cuts, and a whole lot of blood. It is a combat sport after all. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The term 'martial arts' means that it is a form of ART and is open to interpretation by anyone who practices this art. As a practitioner, I want to spread my own perception of Muay Thai to others. Some might look at Muay Thai as a 'keep-fit' regimen, 'self-confidence' booster, 'self-defence' technique and many others. But I see it very differently...
    </p>
    <p>
        Muay Thai empowers you with a variety of things! The obvious things would be elevating your fitness levels, giving you self-defense skils or if you wish, competing with others for a sense of achievement. But it is so much more... It will pass onto you intangible yet valuable gains such as humility, self-confidence, self-esteem, mental toughness, situation awareness, self-respect, respect for others, fun-loving social interactions, and more! I am an embodiment whose life has been shaped by this. Let me share with you my story as to you will benefit from this.  
    </p>

        This is my story...
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unfit and I were a couple 10 years ago. Being a teenager and overly aware of my own physical limitations, I often complained about knee joint pains, calf tensions, and had very poor peformances in cardio-exercisies. I know we are all familiar with the term "I hate running". 
    </p>
    <p>
        I had exceedingly low self-esteem and self-confidence in the past and unfortunately became the target of some bullying probes. Maybe I should consider myself quite fortunate as they were mainly passive-aggressive and I have heard of some extreme bullying cases which I don't even want to delve into.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2006, Muay Thai had no presence in Singapore, a that time I was a teenager with had so much energy, both positive and negative, pent up inside of me with no method of channelling it. Simplying lifting weights, doing push-ups and running was no where close to expelling it. The simplicity of static and one-dimensional dynamic exercises was not exciting at all for me. But there was one thing I knew, and it was that I loved hitting this boxing bag at my neighbour's house. Something tells me that I am not alone on this... If you believe yourself or even your kids have a lot of energy pent up, I believe I will be able to solve that problem, just like I have for myself.
